# WiFi Indoor Positioning
Evaluate techniques for indoor user localization using WiFi Fingerprints

## Overview
In this project we are working for a client that is developing a indoor positioning system 
to be deployed on large industrial campuses, in shopping malls etc. to help people navigate
complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost. Our client would like us to to investigate
the feasibility to use "WiFi Fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces

Our goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the location of a user in a campus,
based on the intensity of the signals received by different wireless access points (WAPs),
obtained from users' mobile devices.

## Dataset
The dataset in this project is the [UJIIndoorLoc](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ujiindoorloc) 
dataset provided by UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This dataset covers three buildings of 
Universitat Jaume I, with 4 or 5 floor depending on the building and covers a surface of almost 110 000 m<sup>2</sup>.

The database consists of 2 files, one containing 19 937 training/reference records ```trainingData.csv``` and other containing 1111 validation/test records ```validationData.csv```. Both sets are composed of 529 attributes and are described below.

Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging from -104 dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0 dBm. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.

## Data preparation 

To get accurate predictive models, we have to get our data in good shape for analysis. In order to get the data more
consistent and remove noise, I have applied the following steps:

- **Remove WAPs with no detected signal**
- **Remove records with no detected signal**
- **Convert values for signals that were not detected:** In the dataset a positive value of 100 was used if a WAP was not detected. When the WiFi signal strengths are given with values between 0 and -104, this will confuse the model. The values for no detected signals were converted from +100 to -105.
- **Remove outliers:** Records(rows) with signal strength higher than -30 dBm were removed from the dataset. In general a signal strength of -30 dBm is considered a max achievable signal strength. With this signal the user can only be a few feet from the AP to achieve this. Not typical or desirable in the real world. Based on this information, I have removed records that contained signal strengths higher than -30 dBm, as I do not want to train my model on these records.
- **Normalize by row:**  In order to make a prediction model, it is preferable to have input that are on the same scale. 
In this case all the signal strengths are measured on the same scale, buth the magnitude ranges from -30 dBm to -105dBm. To prevent these magnitude differences biasing our model, I have applied normalization by row (min-max scaling).

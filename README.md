# WiFi Indoor Positioning
Evaluate techniques for indoor user localization using WiFi Fingerprints

## Overview
In this project we are working for a client that is developing a indoor positioning system 
to be deployed on large industrial campuses, in shopping malls etc. to help people navigate
complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost. Our client would like us to to investigate
the feasibility to use "WiFi Fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces

Our goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the location of user's mobile device

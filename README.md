# WiFi Indoor Positioning
Evaluate techniques for indoor user localization using WiFi Fingerprints

## Overview
In this project we are working for a client that is developing a indoor positioning system 
to be deployed on large industrial campuses, in shopping malls etc. to help people navigate
complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost. Our client would like us to to investigate
the feasibility to use "WiFi Fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces

Our goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the location of a user in a campus,
based on the intensity of the signals received by different wireless access points (WAPs),
obtained from users' mobile devices.

## Dataset
The dataset in this project is the [UJIIndoorLoc](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ujiindoorloc) 
dataset provided by UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This dataset covers three buildings of 
Universitat Jaume I, with 4 or 5 floor depending on the building and covers a surface of almost 110 000 m<sup>2</sup>.

The database consists of 2 files, one containing 19 937 training/reference records ```trainingData.csv``` and other containing 1111 validation/test records ```validationData.csv```. Both sets are composed of 529 attributes and are described below.

Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging from -104 dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0 dBm. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.
